She, she will be loved, be loved.
She, she will be loved, be loved.
Beauty queen of only eighteen, she had some trouble with herself.
She was always there to help her.
She always belonged to someone else.
Now I drove for miles and miles and wound up at your door.
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more.
I don't mind spending everyday.
Out on your corner in the pouring rain.
Look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay a while.
And she will be loved, and she will be loved.
Tap on my window, knock on my door I, want to make you feel beautiful.
I know I tend to get so insecure, doesn't matter anymore.
It's not always rainbows and butterflies, it's compromise that moves us along.
Yeah, my heart is full and my door's always open, you come anytime you want.
Yeah.
I don't mind spending everyday.
Out on your corner in the pouring rain.
Look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay a while.
And she will be loved, and she will be loved.
And she will be loved, and she will be loved.
I know where you hide alone in your car.
No one loves the things that make you who you are.
I know that good bye means nothing at all, comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls.
Tap on my window, knock on my door I, want to make you feel beautiful.
I don't mind spending everyday.
Out on your corner in the pouring rain.
Look for the girl with the broken smile, ask her if she wants to stay a while.
And she will be loved, and she will be loved.
And she will be loved, and she will be loved.
Yeah, yeah yeah.
I don't mind spending everyday.
Out on your corner in the pouring rain.
Please don't try so hard to say good bye.
End.
